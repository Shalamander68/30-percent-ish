### REV 1
basic layout and trace routeing. non functonal and incomplete
### REV 1.1
better layout and components. basic trace routing, but still useing matrix.
### REV 2
hopefulley switches to non matrix and adds per key LEDs. it also may addd a seprate control board.
### REV 3
brings to keyboard to a point where it shuld work, after this point changes will be minor.

## stuff to do
- just about every thing
## PCB manufacturing
- some cool options here

# detailed design
~~- switch to pico from pro micro~~
- mount pico pins between keys
~~- make switches more compact and closer toghther~~
- break apart boards (expantion cards and breakout boards all in one go?)
~~- Blutooth controler~~
- per key LEDs?
